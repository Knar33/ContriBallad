Overview

When the page initially loads (body onload), GetUserContributions(knar33), then UpdateContributionGraph()
Text box for user to input a github account. Submit button fires off GetUserContributions(userInput) for the selected
Play button - fires off PlaySong()
	*maybe* turns into pause button - PauseSong()
big pretty contribution graph
	
Functions:
	GetUserContributions(userID)
		GET https://github.com/users/:userID/contributions
		Parse the html response into an array of contributions[]
	PlaySong
		Loop with a delay at the end. 
		Either goes through each week once then stops, or loops endlessly (would require pauseSong function)




function GetUserContributions(userID) {
	const calendarGraph = document.getElementsByClassName('js-calendar-graph')[0];
	const dailyContributions = calendarGraph.getElementsByClassName('day');
	const days = [];

	for (let day of dailyContributions){
		days.push({
		   date: day.getAttribute('data-date'),
		   count: day.getAttribute('data-count')
		}); 
	}
	
	return days;
}

TODO:
get the contribution chart dynamically from github
dynamic scale based on the starting letter of the user: a = c major, b = c minor, c = c# major, d = c# minor etc
dynamic drum kit based on starting letter too ?
