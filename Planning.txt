Overview

When the page initially loads (body onload), GetUserContributions(knar33), then UpdateContributionGraph()
Text box for user to input a github account. Submit button fires off GetUserContributions(userInput) for the selected
Play button - fires off PlaySong()
	*maybe* turns into pause button - PauseSong()
big pretty contribution graph
	
Functions:
	GetUserContributions(userID)
		GET https://github.com/users/:userID/contributions
		Parse the html response into an array of contributions[]
	PlaySong
		Loop with a delay at the end. 
		Either goes through each week once then stops, or loops endlessly (would require pauseSong function)


TODO:
x	get the contribution chart dynamically from github
x	dynamic scale based on the starting letter of the user: a = c major, b = c minor, c = c# major, d = c# minor etc
x	isolate the part of the html we need instead of displaying everything from the Contributions endpoint
x	animation to show which week the song is playing
x	strip halloween
	Add an incication that the contribution chart is being loaded
	dynamic drum kit based on starting letter too ?
